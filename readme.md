# PalGen
PalGen (PALette GENerator) is a palette generator for things that don't generate colors using plain RGB (for example, old video game consoles). Right now, PalGen is focused on the NTSC version of the NES, but in the future it may be extended to support other things.

## Usage
It's HTML5, just download the files and open `index.html` in your favorite browser. If you intend on publically hosting this online, please leave the link to the [GitHub project](https://github.com/DragWx/PalGen) intact.
